Datapack that turns fishing rods into grappling hooks with real motion, like in _MineZ!_

Simply cast your bobber onto a solid block, then reel it in to pull yourself with real motion and physics.

Great for adventure maps, minigames, or survival worlds where you want more mobility for exploration.

- Pull strength scales with bobber distance.
- Vanilla fishing and hooking mobs/items still work as normal.
- Fully multiplayer compatible.
- Made using Smithed Datapack Conventions to be highly compatible with other datapacks.

Feel free to use for custom maps, servers, and more!
